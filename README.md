## Deliverable Two: Mentorship Eligibility
- 1,549 potential retirees are suitable for the mentorship program

# Summary
## Silver Tsunami Forecast
The so-called "Silver Tsunami" will cause Pewlett-Hackard to see approximately 72,458 open roles.

Assuming that mentors would be willing to work 25 hours per week and meet with their mentees for 20 minutes per week, there are enough mentors. Similarly, mentoring could be done in hour blocks every three weeks. The actual cadence would ideally match the flow of the work.

Two additional tables have been created to provide further analysis. The first table focuses in on the titles of those who are eligible for the mentorship program.
